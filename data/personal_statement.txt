The world is wide, and life is short. This lesson learned while traveling has driven my life; I have decided not to fear change.

As I found my interest in Computer Science at an early age, I chose to attend Informatics College, Pokhara. However, my satisfaction in the college did not last long. So,  beside that i keep researching on Webs and built my own interest for it.

Apart from Programmings I love doing Logo designing. Ever since I was exposed to web development in elementary school, my passion for this have grown tremendously through web design. As a hobby, I like to sing, play guitar, and hangout different places. In the future, I hope to create some projects that shows people the beauty behind design.
